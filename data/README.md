##Dataset Information

This project uses the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) dataset.

The dataset includes clinical and molecular features such as age at diagnosis, tumor size, lymph node involvement, Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), hormone receptor status, and survival outcomes.

Due to data usage and redistribution restrictions, the full dataset is not included in this repository.

The data can be accessed from:
- cBioPortal (METABRIC Breast Cancer Study)
- Kaggle (METABRIC Breast Cancer Dataset)

Only derived features and model outputs are used in this project.
