Late Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction (Capstone)

This repository contains my MS Capstone Project for the Applied Computer Science program at American University.

The project explores the use of machine learning models to predict late breast cancer recurrence using clinical data.
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated, and SHAP and LIME were used to explain model predictions.
